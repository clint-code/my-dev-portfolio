## Overview

This passion project that started back in 2019, was an answer to a question I had for a while, "Is there a platform where I can get all information about the heroes and villains in DC and Marvel?"

So I embarked on this project by doing UI Sketches and designs using Adobe XD and proceeded to development.

## Key Interactive Features

- **Character Filter**: Using the ngx-masonry package, you can filter characters based of the categories of Villains and Heroes.
- **Reading Progress Bar**: As you read any of the articles, a bar keeps track of your reading progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: For breaking down the UI into reusable components.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the components.
- **Netlify**: For building, depoying and hosting this web application
- **Contentful CMS**: API First architecture that delivers content via RESTFUL API, which is easy to integrate with the web application 
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For adding interactive animation effects, enhancing the user-experience.
