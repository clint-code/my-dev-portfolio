## Overview

After starting the monthly hikes this year, as well as the gradual demand for them, I found it fit, to develop a website for
hiking enthusiasts to book as well as share stories of the hiking experiences.

Though still in development and not in production, yet, I've shared a teaser of what's done so far.
